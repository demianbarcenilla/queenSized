timeline:

-the pillow council is in charge of managing everything sleep-related, their goal is to make sure every citizen gets proper rest to pursue everyday activities, thus improving efficiency in society

-the pillow council is VERY mean, tho. one day, they betrayed one of the members 

-they invented usefull stuff like naps and long naps to recover some sleep, but this is nothing more than a boost in case it's needed to recover energy

-pillows have powers like healing and modifying dreams, and they learnt how to make people learn a milder version of these powers, called skills.

-example: HEAL => NAP. Heal does the same, but it's unlimited. Pillow needs to wait till she uses it again bc she has weak magic (shes fucking dumb)

CHANGING DREAMS => SWITCH LIFE BAR. You can see it like this: changing dreams would make you more/less tired depending on if you're changing it to a nightmare (better SCARE/DRAIN) or to a nice or CONFUSING dream

Switching life bar would be like switching dreams, if you're tired and the enemy is not, it'd mean you switch "tiredness" with the enemy, thus, the life bar is more like an energy bar (that's why the enemies don't really DIE, but faint instead)

HOW DO THEY MAKE SKILLS??
1- crush a bunch of cotton plants
2- prepare liquid magic: pillow specialists use their magic powers in tree sap, which retains part of the magic
3-mix this liquid magic with the cotton plants in a blender. the liquid magic makes contains the spells you want to use and the cotton plants make it easier to distribute and implement
4 -mix in recipes (CHEESE, GHOST COOKIES, LEMONADES), objects and plants(SHROOM, CROWN, RUBBISH, RAT FLUTE), or pills (more abstract skills like NAP, SCARE, CONFUSE)

-pillow was deemed too stupid to belong to the pillow council, so they put her on a dumb chore so she feels like she's doing something (guarding a big big matress that no one will sleep on)

-the council also has a GIANT library where they keep track of everything, they also have:

-the white book talks about an old member of the council, the one who managed to turn magic into learnable skills. they're currently dead, and the book is a biography on this pillow mage

-the black book says they were trying to achieve immortality by automatically regaining your energy once it hits zero, about the methods they used and a theory: this member DID find out how to reach some sorta immortality. the book says when pillows die you can still feel the magic in their corpse, before it slowly fades away after weeks

the black book says this source of magic in the corpse was nowhere to be found when this member died

-the green book talks about the skills, how they are made and what are they made out of

-the red book talks about attack and defense. how to engage in battle, battle strategies and defense

-the blue book talks about talks about specialties, those special skills almost everyone has. theorizes about why people have them and how to find out what your specialty is



-the queen is the ruler of [[the world]] and she's pretty decent at it

-one day, the incinerator gains sentience

-the queen makes matresses illegal

the reason behind this is: the head of the council killed himself and possessed the incinerator. they found out about the way of immortality the old pillow member invented, noticed it kills you but lets your soul and magic linger in the physical world, and took advantage of it to possess the incinerator

this is the deal with the queen: she has to make people as tired as she can. if the incinerator is unhappy with the results, it'll kill itself, reseting the whole world in the process. this also happens if it dies naturally (like when pillow chokes it with a big matress)

the head council wants to make people tired so they depend on the council and their products

the reason the incinerator cannot handle big matresses is bc this machine was built to process smaller stuff like dead leaves/plants and other resources. the ashes are used to cheaply build stuff like bricks or vases

the reason the earth resets itself after the head council dies for real is bc the immortality spell works that way. if death CANNOT be avoided, then it'll be rewinded

the only way to defeat the incinerator is to use the skill "PILLOW SOUL" on it. you earn it by opening the white book in front of the queen

this will spawn the soul of the original creator of immortality, who will possess the incinerator as well.

when you kill the incinerator with the two souls, they will BOTH reset. this'd mean:
1- resets the earth back to zero
2- resets the earth back to the current moment in time

negating the effect of the reset, killing both souls in the process.

this makes matresses legal again, the council becomes a library and pillow handles it. good ending

/*
the old pillow feels sad and angry, because she did a lot of research and progress on public magic. the problem is: the council didn't like magic to be public

the magic pillows possess is the reason they have a council that controls sleep. if people can take care of their own sleep, they're no longer necessary and are only useful as a big library

that's why when the dead pillow made a breaktrough on making public magic they decided to kill her

and that's why they water down the skills they sell so instead of giving you the raw power of a full night's sleep, they give you the small power of a 15 minute nap instead

and they sell this instead of making it free, being that this kinda magic is excesively cheap to make
